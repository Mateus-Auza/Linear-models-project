# Wine Quality Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression analysis of the Wine Quality dataset using classical linear modeling techniques in R.

This project develops and validates a linear regression model to explain the factors influencing **citric acid concentration** in red wines. The analysis includes feature engineering, model selection, diagnostic testing, statistical inference, and model validation.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Original source:
[uci.edu/dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)



The dataset contains physicochemical measurements of Portuguese *Vinho Verde* wines and is commonly used for regression and classification problems.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to:

- Build a multiple linear regression model for predicting **citric acid concentration**.
- Select the best subset of predictors.
- Verify the classical assumptions of linear regression.
- Detect influential observations and multicollinearity.
- Evaluate predictive performance on a validation dataset.
- Interpret the effects of quantitative and qualitative variables.

## Methodology

The analysis consists of:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Best subset selection
4. Forward model selection
5. Linear regression diagnostics
   - Linearity
   - Influential observations
   - Multicollinearity
   - Heteroskedasticity
   - Autocorrelation
6. Model refinement
7. Statistical inference
8. Validation using prediction intervals

## Main Results

- Selected a parsimonious multiple linear regression model using best subset and forward selection.
- Removed influential observations identified through DFFITS.
- Resolved multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
- Corrected heteroskedasticity using Weighted Least Squares.
- Addressed autocorrelation using the Cochrane–Orcutt procedure.
- Achieved approximately **90% prediction interval coverage** on the validation set.

The final model provides meaningful statistical inference, although the validation results suggest that the relationship between the predictors and citric acid concentration may not be perfectly linear.
